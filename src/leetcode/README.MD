# LEETCODE TASKS

----------------

[TwoSum](TwoSum.java) - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

[Search Insert Position](SearchInsertPosition.java) - Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

[Roman To Integer](RomanToInteger.java) - Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

[Reverse Integer](ReverseInteger.java) - Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

[Remove Element](RemoveElement.java) - Given an array nums and a value val, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

[Longest Common Prefix](LongestCommonPrefix.java) - Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

[SingleNumber](SingleNumber.java) - Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

[MergeTwoSortedLists](MergeTwoSortedLists.java) - Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

[ValidParentheses](ValidParentheses.java) - Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

[RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray](RemoveDuplicatesFromSortedArray.java) - Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

[ImplementStrStr](ImplementStrStr.java) - Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
