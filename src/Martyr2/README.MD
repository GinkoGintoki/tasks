# Martyr2’s Mega Project List


Trying to complete all projects from [Martyr2’s Mega Project List](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/).


## Numbers
---------

[**_Find PI to the Nth Digit_**](FindPiToTheNthDigit.java) – Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

[**_Fibonacci Sequence_**](Fibonacci.java) – Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

[**_Prime Factorization_**](PrimeFactorization.java) – Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.

[**_Next Prime Number_**](NextPrimeNumber.java) – Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.

[**_Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor_**](CostOfTile.java) – Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.

[**_Mortgage Calculator_**](MortgageCalculator.java) – Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan.

[**_Change Return Program_**](ChangeReturnProgram.java) – The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.

[**_Binary to Decimal and Back Converter_**](DecimalBinaryConverter.java) – Develop a converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

[**_Calculator_**]() – A simple calculator to do basic operators. Make it a scientific calculator for added complexity.

[**_Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more)_**]() – Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The program will then make the conversion.

[**_Alarm Clock_**]() – A simple clock where it plays a sound after X number of minutes/seconds or at a particular time.

[**_Distance Between Two Cities_**]() – Calculates the distance between two cities and allows the user to specify a unit of distance. This program may require finding coordinates for the cities like latitude and longitude.

[**_Credit Card Validator_**]() – Takes in a credit card number from a common credit card vendor (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discoverer) and validates it to make sure that it is a valid number (look into how credit cards use a checksum).

[**_Tax Calculator_**]() – Asks the user to enter a cost and either a country or state tax. It then returns the tax plus the total cost with tax.

[**_Factorial Finder_**]() - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.

[**_Complex Number Algebra_**]() - Show addition, multiplication, negation, and inversion of complex numbers in separate functions. (Subtraction and division operations can be made with pairs of these operations.) Print the results for each operation tested.

[**_Happy Numbers_**]() - A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Take an input number from user, and find first 8 happy numbers from that input.

[**_Number Names_**]() - Show how to spell out a number in English. You can use a preexisting implementation or roll your own, but you should support inputs up to at least one million (or the maximum value of your language's default bounded integer type, if that's less). *Optional: Support for inputs other than positive integers (like zero, negative integers, and floating-point numbers).*
